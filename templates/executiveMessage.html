And imagine with me if you had never joined Etisalat, and instead worked for a different company in a different industry. Imagine never knowing or meeting the people you’ve worked with here or even befriended. Imagine even being isolated from telecom technologies. It’s a profound thought experiment. Some of you will say c’est la vie, but if you’re like me, you’d be saddened and feel like missing out. If you’re like me, and went back in time, you’d still want to join Etisalat. We have come a long way, fellow colleagues, and this time there are a couple of things we cannot afford to ignore or even imagine missing out.</p><p class=cardText>Network Function Virtualisation (NFV) and Software-Defined Networking (SDN) are technologies emerging in our telecommunications industry, as results of many converging drivers, like the rise of the new economy (think Uber and Airbnb), the need for speed and instant gratification (think streaming services and Google’s quick answers to our questions) and the growing maturity of underlying technologies (think cloud, servers and software). However, for me, NFV and SDN represent more than just inevitable new technologies—they are gateways to a new future, different than the one we had dreamed of in the past.</p><p class=cardText>We have been studying, experimenting and testing NFV and SDN PoCs in the past couple of years, and now Etisalat’s leadership beginning with our CEO, Mr. Saleh Al Abdooli, understands the importance of taking it to the next level. That’s why the three-year corporate programme ‘Cloudify the Network’, or ‘Sahaab’, has been officially launched, sponsored by our CTO, Mr. Haitham Abdulrazzak, to both transform Etisalat UAE to best leverage these new technologies and to influence these new technologies towards the good of our employees, customers and shareholders.</p><p class=cardText>Dear colleagues, I am honoured and excited to lead the Sahaab programme with you all. The Sahaab team is at your service for further information, so stay tuned for their updates, workshops and involvements. You wouldn’t want to miss out.</p></div></div></div></div></div></div><br></div><div class=row><form class="col s12"><div class=row><div class="input-field col s12"><input id=email type=email class=validate> <label for=email data-error=wrong data-success=right>Email</label></div></div></form></div></div>
